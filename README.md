## Setup Notes

1. React Icons

```javascript
import { FaHome } from "react-icons/fa"
const Component = () => {
  return <FaHome className="icon"></FaHome>
}
```

2. Use main.css - less imports
3. Limit amount of components - better overview
4. All components ready to go (including imports)
5. Use constants to avoid repetition.
